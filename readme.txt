Project has been developed using python 3 and is divided into 3 parts:-

1) Homography - Performing perspective transformations on images and then seamlessly stitching them together using RANSAC and k-nearest neighbors techniques.

2) Epipola Geometry - Applying epipolar geometry to find the homography/fundamental mtrix and finding the epipolar lines on a set of stereoscopic images.

3) Color Quantization - using K-means clustering to quantize colors and reduce the number of colors used in an image with minimal loss in image features.

This project has been developed using python as part of coursework CSE573 Computer Vision at SUNY- University at Buffalo.

Three tasks are present in their respective folders

1) task1 can be run using task1.py

2)task2 can be run using task2.py

3)task3 can be run using task3.py

4) Output is generated in the respective subfolders and console.
